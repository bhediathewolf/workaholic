# Workaholic

Workaholic is your perfect productivity companion.
How?
It allows you to create your comprehensive to do list using Remember The Milk.
Then, you can obliterate your tasks using the Pomodoro Technique.
This automatically assumes the tasks you are working on and assigns the last Pomodoro to it.
This gives you a chance to give each task a esitimate and measure how close were you to that.
Workaholic will keep churning tasks at you until either your work or you is obliterated.
It is the productivity app for the most hardcore professionals.
